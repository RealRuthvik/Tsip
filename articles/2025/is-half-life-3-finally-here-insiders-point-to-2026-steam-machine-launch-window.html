                    <p>Valve is reportedly aiming to release its next-generation Steam Machine in the spring of 2026. This new hardware is expected to debut alongside specific peripherals known as the Frame and the Controller. Veteran journalist Mike Straw suggests the console will feature Half-Life 3 as a major launch title. However, the release plans are currently threatened by a crisis in the component market. An AI-driven shortage has allegedly pushed RAM prices up by 300% to 500%. Consequently, Valve is hesitant to finalize the console's price or make official announcements. The company fears that passing these manufacturing costs to the consumer would lead to backlash over expensive PC-style pricing.</p>

                    <p>These reports currently remain unverified rumors with no official comment from Valve, fresh reports suggest the decades long wait for Gordon Freeman's return may finally target a 2026 release window.</p>
