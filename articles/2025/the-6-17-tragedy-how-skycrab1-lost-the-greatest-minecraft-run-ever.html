                    <p>SkyCrab1 was on track for a historic breakthrough, utilizing an exceptional seed (-8013304087800663174) with a Looting 3 diamond sword to achieve lightning fast splits. Entering the Stronghold twenty seconds ahead of the world record pace, he was set to shatter the standing record by forty-seven seconds. A completion would have effectively killed the category, setting a sub 6:30 time so perfect it would discourage future competition by making the top spot seem unreachable. However, his blistering pace left him without defensive blocks for the Ender Dragon fight. While crafting items for his bed cycles, he accidentally looked at an Enderman for a fraction of a second. Though he managed to slay the dragon, the aggroed Enderman struck him down in the fountain at the final moment, transforming a world record into the most devastating choke the community has ever seen.</p>

                    <h3>AUTHOR'S NOTE</h3>
                    <p>It is a total gut punch to watch this run fall apart right at the finish line. Massive respect to Skycrab1 for pulling off something so insane, even if the game didn't let him have the win he deserved.</p>
