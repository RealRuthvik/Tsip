This leads to footage of a subterranean realm that defies the game's natural generation. The \"World That Doesn't Exist\" is filled with impossible sights: massive underground forests made of stacked trees, tunnels of mudbrick, and unsettling silence. The atmosphere is thick with tension, punctuated by the sound of phantom footsteps that stop just a fraction of a second too late and whispers that seem to follow the player through the dark.",

Instead of running blindly, Avery uses advanced Minecraft mechanics to prove he is being hunted in a single-player world. He sets \"chunk-loading traps,\" using hoppers and grass-spreading mechanics to detect if another entity is nearby while he is away. These moments provide a grounded, scientific approach to the supernatural, making the eventual realization that he is being followed even more impactful.",
